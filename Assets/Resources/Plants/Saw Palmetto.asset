  plantDetails: Saw palmetto is a type of small palm tree found in Florida and parts
    of other southeastern states. It has long, green, pointed leaves like many types
    of palm trees. It also has branches with small berries.
  plantTrivia: Did you know - Native Americans from the Seminole tribe in Florida
    traditionally ate saw palmetto berries for food and to treat urinary and reproductive
    problems associated with an enlarged prostate gland. They also used it to treat
    cough, indigestion, sleeping problems, and infertility.
  plantMedicalUses: Saw palmetto is a supplement made from the fruit of the Serenoa
    repens tree. It's often used to treat enlarged prostate, improve urinary function,
    and enhance hair growth. Some also use the supplement to boost libido and fertility
    and reduce inflammation. Finally, saw palmetto is claimed to have anticancer
    effects.
