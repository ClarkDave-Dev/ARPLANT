  plantDetails: "Saw palmetto is a supplement made from the fruit of the Serenoa
    repens tree.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s often used to treat enlarged prostate, improve
    urinary function, and enhance hair growth. Some also use the supplement to boost
    libido and fertility and reduce inflammation. Finally, saw palmetto is claimed
    to have anticancer effects.\r\n\r\nHowever, not all of its uses and purported
    health benefits are supported by science.\r\n\r\nThis article looks at the research
    behind saw palmetto, including its benefits, potential side effects, and dosage
    recommendations."
  plantTrivia: Did you know - Native Americans from the Seminole tribe in Florida
    traditionally ate saw palmetto berries for food and to treat urinary and reproductive
    problems associated with an enlarged prostate gland. They also used it to treat
    cough, indigestion, sleeping problems, and infertility.
  plantMedicalUses: "May benefit prostate health and urinary function\r\nSaw palmetto
    may help treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) \u2014 a medical condition
    characterized by a slow, noncancerous yet abnormal enlargement of the prostate.\r\n\r\nBPH
    is common in older men, affecting up to 75% of men in their 70s.\r\n\r\nIf left
    untreated, the prostate can enlarge to the point of interfering with the ability
    to properly empty the bladder. It can also increase the frequency and urge to
    urinate, often causing excessive nighttime urination which may disrupt sleep.\r\n\r\nBPH
    is part of a larger group of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), a group of
    symptoms typically involving the bladder, urethra, and prostate. Unlike BPH,
    LUTS can affect both men and women.\r\n\r\nSeveral studies have looked at saw
    palmetto\u2019s effect on LUTS \u2014 with mixed results.\r\n\r\nEarly studies
    reported that saw palmetto may help increase urine flow and reduce nighttime
    urination in men with BPH \u2014 both when used alone or in combination with
    traditional drug therapy.\r\n\r\nHowever, the latest Cochrane review \u2014 the
    highest standard in evidence-based healthcare \u2014 concluded that saw palmetto
    provides little improvement in LUTS.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, two reviews note
    that a daily dose of 320 mg of Permixon \u2014 a specific saw palmetto extract
    \u2014 was more effective than a placebo at improving urine flow and reducing
    nighttime urination.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s possible that the effects vary based on
    the strength of the individual formulation. Overall, more studies are needed
    before strong conclusions can be made.\r\n\r\nMay reduce male pattern baldness\r\nSaw
    palmetto may help prevent androgenic alopecia \u2014 a type of hair loss also
    known as male and female pattern baldness in men and women, respectively.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
    thought to work by blocking the enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone
    (DHT), an androgen-type hormone believed to cause this form of hair loss.\r\n\r\nHigher
    levels of androgen hormones like DHT are thought to shorten the hair growth cycle
    and lead to the growth of shorter and thinner strands of hair (15).\r\n\r\nOne
    small study reports that a daily 200-mg dose of saw palmetto \u2014 taken with
    another beneficial plant compound known as beta-sitosterol \u2014 reduced hair
    loss in 60% of men with androgenic alopecia compared to a placebo.\r\n\r\nIn
    a 2-year study, men with male pattern baldness were given 320 mg of saw palmetto
    per day or finasteride, a conventional hair loss medication.\r\n\r\nBy the end
    of the study, about one-third of those given saw palmetto reported an increase
    in hair growth. That said, saw palmetto was only half as effective as the conventional
    medication.\r\n\r\nA small study also reports a small increase in hair count
    in about half of the men treated with a saw palmetto hair lotion. However, this
    lotion also contained other active ingredients, making it difficult to isolate
    the effect of saw palmetto (18).\r\n\r\nAlthough promising, the research on saw
    palmetto\u2019s effect on hair loss is limited. More studies are needed before
    strong conclusions can be made.\r\n\r\nOther potential benefits\r\nSaw palmetto
    is touted as providing additional benefits \u2014 though most are unsupported
    by strong science.\r\n\r\nFor instance, test-tube research shows that Permixon
    \u2013 a specific formulation of saw palmetto \u2013 may reduce markers of inflammation
    in prostate cells. However, it\u2019s unclear whether other saw palmetto supplements
    have the same effec.\r\n\r\nPermixon may also protect libido and fertility in
    men. Conventional drug therapy for BPH and LUTS has been shown to negatively
    impact sexual function in men.\r\n\r\nA review of 12 randomized controlled studies
    \u2014 the gold standard in nutrition research \u2014 compared Permixon with
    conventional drug therapy as a treatment for BPH and LUTS.\r\n\r\nThough both
    produced negative side effects on male sexual function, the saw palmetto supplement
    led to smaller drops in libido and lower impotence compared to the conventional
    drug treatment.\r\n\r\nStill, it\u2019s unclear whether Permixon has the same
    effect in healthy men or whether other saw palmetto formulations offer similar
    protective benefits.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s more, additional studies list decreased
    libido as a potential side effect of taking saw palmetto supplements \u2014 so
    more research is needed to confirm this.\r\n\r\nFinally, test-tube research suggests
    that saw palmetto may help kill and slow the growth of certain cancer cells,
    including of the prostate. Although promising, not all studies agree, and more
    research is needed"
  plantGeneralInfo: "Serenoa repens, commonly known as saw palmetto, is the sole
    species currently classified in the genus Serenoa. It is a small palm, growing
    to a maximum height around 7\u201310 ft. It is endemic to Southeastern United
    States, most commonly along the south Atlantic and Gulf Coastal plains. It grows
    in clumps or dense thickets in sandy coastal areas, and as undergrowth in pine
    woods or hardwood hammocks."
