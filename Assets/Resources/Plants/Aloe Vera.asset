  plantTrivia: "The word \u201Caloe\u201D comes from the Arabic term alloeh, which
    means \u201Cshining bitter substance,\u201D and \u201Cvera\u201D comes from the
    Latin word veritas, meaning \u201Ctruth.\u201D And it\u2019s true, the juice
    of the whole processed leaf is invigoratingly bitter."
  plantMedicalUses: "Aloe vera contains cooling properties similar to menthol. This
    is perhaps the plant\u2019s best known quality. Gently apply the gel to soothe
    and heal sunburns, minor kitchen burns, scrapes, and itchy insect bites."
  plantGeneralInfo: Aloe vera is a succulent plant species of the genus Aloe. An
    evergreen perennial, it originates from the Arabian Peninsula, but grows wild
    in tropical, semi-tropical, and arid climates around the world. It is cultivated
    for agricultural and medicinal uses.
