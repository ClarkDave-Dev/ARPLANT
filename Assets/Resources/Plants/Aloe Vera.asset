  plantDetails: Aloe is a succulent plant that grows in hot, dry climates. The most
    common medicinal variety is Aloe vera (barbadensis Miller), which has been clinically
    shown to have the most nutrients of the over 500 species of aloe throughout the
    world.
  plantTrivia: "The word \u201Caloe\u201D comes from the Arabic term alloeh, which
    means \u201Cshining bitter substance,\u201D and \u201Cvera\u201D comes from the
    Latin word veritas, meaning \u201Ctruth.\u201D And it\u2019s true, the juice
    of the whole processed leaf is invigoratingly bitter."
  plantMedicalUses: "1. It contains healthful plant compounds.\r\nAloe vera is known
    for its thick, pointed, and fleshy green leaves, which may grow to about 12\u201319
    inches (30\u201350 centimeters) in length.\r\nEach leaf contains a slimy tissue
    that stores water, and this makes the leaves thick. This water filled tissue
    is the \u201Cgel\u201D that people associate with aloe vera products.\r\nThe
    gel contains most of the beneficial bioactive compounds in the plant, including
    vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and antioxidants.\r\n\r\n2. It has antioxidant
    and antibacterial properties\r\nAntioxidants are important for health. Aloe vera
    gel contains powerful antioxidants belonging to a large family of substances
    known as polyphenols.\r\nThese polyphenols, along with several other compounds
    in aloe vera, help inhibit the growth of certain bacteria that can cause infections
    in humans.\r\nAloe vera is known for its antibacterial, antiviral, and antiseptic
    properties. This is part of why it may help heal wounds and treat skin problems.\r\n\r\n3.
    It accelerates wound healing\r\nPeople most often use aloe vera as a topical
    medication, rubbing it onto the skin rather than consuming it. In fact, it has
    a long history of use in treating sores, and particularly burns, including sunburn.\r\nThe
    United States Pharmacopeia describe aloe vera preparations as a skin protectant
    as early as 1810\u20131820.\r\nStudies suggest that it is an effective topical
    treatment for first and second degree burns.\r\nFor example, a review of experimental
    studies found that aloe vera could reduce the healing time of burns by around
    9 days compared with conventional medication. It also helped prevent redness,
    itching, and infections.\r\nThe evidence for aloe vera helping heal other types
    of wound is inconclusive, but the research is promising.\r\n\r\n4. It reduces
    dental plaque\r\nTooth decay and diseases of the gum are very common health problems.
    One of the best ways to prevent these conditions is to reduce the buildup of
    plaque, or bacterial biofilms, on the teeth.\r\nIn a mouth rinse study of 300
    healthy people, researchers compared 100% pure aloe vera juice with the standard
    mouthwash ingredient chlorhexidine.\r\nAfter 4 days of use, the aloe vera mouth
    rinse appeared to be just as effective as chlorhexidine in reducing dental plaque.\r\nAnother
    study found similar benefits of aloe vera mouth rinse over a 15- to 30-day period.\r\nAloe
    vera is effective in killing the plaque-producing bacterium Streptococcus mutans
    in the mouth, as well as the yeast Candida albicans.\r\n\r\n5. It helps treat
    canker sores\r\nMany people experience mouth ulcers, or canker sores, at some
    point in their lives. These usually form underneath the lip, inside the mouth,
    and last for about a week.\r\nStudies have shown that aloe vera treatment can
    accelerate the healing of mouth ulcers.\r\nFor example, in a 7-day study of 180
    people with recurrent mouth ulcers, applying an aloe vera patch to the area was
    effective in reducing the size of the ulcers.\r\nHowever, it did not outperform
    the conventional ulcer treatment: corticosteroids.\r\nIn another study, aloe
    vera gel not only accelerated the healing of mouth ulcers, it also reduced the
    pain associated with them.\r\n\r\n6. It reduces constipation\r\nAloe vera may
    also help treat constipation.\r\nThis time it is the latex, not the gel, that
    provides the benefits. The latex is a sticky yellow residue present just under
    the skin of the leaf.\r\nThe key compound responsible for this effect is called
    aloin, or barbaloin, which has well-established laxative effects.\r\nHowever,
    people have raised concerns about safety with frequent use. For this reason,
    aloe latex has not been available in the U.S. as an over-the-counter medication
    since 2002.\r\nContrary to popular belief, aloe vera does not appear to be effective
    against other digestive conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory
    bowel disease.\r\n\r\n7. It may improve skin and prevent wrinkles\r\nThere is
    some preliminary evidence to suggest that topical aloe vera gel can slow aging
    of the skin.\r\nIn a 2009 study of 30 females over the age of 45, taking oral
    aloe vera gel increased collagen production and improved skin elasticity over
    a 90-day period.\r\nReviews also suggest that aloe vera could help the skin retain
    moisture and improve skin integrity, which could benefit dry skin conditions.\r\n\r\n8.
    It lowers blood sugar levels\r\nPeople sometimes use aloe vera as a remedy for
    diabetes. This is because it may enhance insulin sensitivity and help improve
    blood sugar management.\r\nFor example, a review of eight studies found that
    aloe vera could have benefits for people with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes
    due to its effects on glycemic control.\r\nHowever, the quality of the existing
    studies is not ideal, so scientists do not currently recommend using aloe vera
    for this purpose.\r\n\r\nRisks\r\nAloe vera is a safe remedy with few known side
    effects.\r\nThe National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)
    say that topical use is likely safe.\r\nThat said, the oral use of aloe vera
    may cause stomach cramps or diarrhea due to its laxative effects. There have
    also been some reports of liver damage associated with long-term aloe vera supplement
    use.\r\nThe NCCIH also report that nondecolorized whole leaf extract of aloe
    vera seems to be associated with cancer risk in rats."
  plantGeneralInfo: Aloe vera is a succulent plant species of the genus Aloe. An
    evergreen perennial, it originates from the Arabian Peninsula, but grows wild
    in tropical, semi-tropical, and arid climates around the world. It is cultivated
    for agricultural and medicinal uses.
