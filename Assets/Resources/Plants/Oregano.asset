  plantDetails: 'Oregano is a plant. The leaf is used to make medicine.

    

    Oregano
    is used for respiratory tract disorders such as coughs, asthma, croup, and bronchitis.
    It is also used for gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as heartburn and bloating.
    Other uses include treating menstrual cramps, rheumatoid arthritis, urinary tract
    disorders including urinary tract infections (UTIs), headaches, and heart conditions.

    

    The
    oil of oregano is taken by mouth for intestinal parasites, allergies, sinus pain,
    arthritis, cold and flu, swine flu, earaches, and fatigue. It is applied to the
    skin for skin conditions including acne, athlete''s foot, oily skin, dandruff,
    canker sores, warts, ringworm, rosacea, and psoriasis; as well as for insect
    and spider bites, gum disease, toothaches, muscle pain, and varicose veins. Oregano
    oil is also used topically as an insect repellent.

    

    In foods and
    beverages, oregano is used as a culinary spice and a food preservative.'
  plantTrivia: Did you know? - Ancient Greeks believed that cows that grazed in fields
    full of oregano had tastier meat.
  plantMedicalUses: "Possibly Effective for\r\nHigh cholesterol. Clinical research
    shows that taking oregano after each meal for 3 months can reduce low-density
    lipoprotein (LDL or \u201Cbad\u201D) cholesterol and increase high-density lipoprotein
    (HDL or \u201Cgood\u201D) cholesterol in people with high cholesterol. However,
    total cholesterol and triglyceride levels are not affected.\r\nParasites in the
    intestines. Taking oil of oregano for 6 weeks can kill the parasites Blastocystis
    hominis, Entamoeba hartmanni, and Endolimax nana.\r\n\r\nInsufficient Evidence
    for\r\nBleeding disorders (hemophilia). Early research suggests that oregano
    might not prevent bleeding after dental procedures in people with hemophilia.\r\nWound
    healing. Early research suggests that applying an oregano extract to the skin
    twice daily for up to 14 days can improve skin color, stiffness, and thickness,
    but does not improve itching, pain, or scars, in people who have had portions
    of skin removed surgically.\r\nRepelling insects.\r\n\r\nSide Effects\r\nOregano
    leaf is LIKELY SAFE when taken in the amounts found in food and POSSIBLY SAFE
    when taken by mouth or applied to the skin in medicinal amounts. Mild side effects
    include stomach upset. Oregano might also cause an allergic reaction in people
    who have an allergy to plants in the Lamiaceae family.\r\n\r\nNot enough is known
    about the safety of using oregano oil in medicinal amounts.\r\n\r\nSpecial Precautions
    and Warnings\r\nPregnancy and breast-feeding: Oregano is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when
    taken by mouth in medicinal amounts during pregnancy. There is concern that oregano
    in amounts larger than food amounts might cause miscarriage. Not enough is known
    about the safety of oregano when used in medicinal amounts while nursing.\r\n\r\nBleeding
    disorders: Oregano might increase the risk of bleeding in people with bleeding
    disorders.\r\n\r\nAllergies: Oregano can cause reactions in people allergic to
    Lamiaceae family plants, including basil, hyssop, lavender, marjoram, mint, and
    sage.\r\n\r\nDiabetes: Oregano might lower blood sugar levels. People with diabetes
    should use oregano cautiously.\r\n\r\nSurgery: Oregano might increase the risk
    of bleeding. People who use oregano should stop 2 weeks before surgery.\r\n\r\nModerate
    Interaction\r\nBe cautious with this combination\r\n\r\nLithium interacts with
    OREGANO\r\nOregano might have an effect like a water pill or \"diuretic.\" Taking
    oregano might decrease how well the body gets rid of lithium. This could increase
    how much lithium is in the body and result in serious side effects. Talk with
    your healthcare provider before using this product if you are taking lithium.
    Your lithium dose might need to be changed."
