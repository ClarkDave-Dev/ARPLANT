  plantDetails: Sambong | Blumea balsamifera DC, a medicinal herb, is widely distributed
    in Eastern and Southeastern Asia. It has been used in folk medicine for its many
    health benefits that include the treatment of septic wounds, respiratory infections,
    stomach pains and kidney stones.
  plantTrivia: Did you know - Sambong is considered as a weed in some countries and
    is difficult to eradicate.
  plantMedicalUses: "Uses\r\nBefore going deeper into Sambong benefits, let us first
    learn a few facts about this amazing medicinal plant. Blumea balsamifera, more
    commonly known to us as \u201CSambong,\u201D has a wide range of health benefits
    that are recognized by the Department of Health (DOH).\r\n\r\nIt is one of the
    10 herbal medicines used in treating certain conditions. Called \u201Csubsob\u201D
    in Ilocos and \u201Cbukadkad\u201D in Visayas, this plant has green leaves and
    a hairy underside and stems that can grow up to 2.5 centimeters. The plant itself
    is tall, growing up to 3.5 meters. \r\n\r\nSambong Benefits as Herbal Medicine\r\nPhytochemical
    and pharmacological reviews have long studied the full potential of Sambong benefits;
    but what exactly are these benefits?\r\n\r\nSambong is an effective treatment
    for kidney stones\r\nIn one study, it was found that Sambong extract decreases
    the size of calcium oxalate crystals. Calcium oxalate is one of the most common
    types of stones found in our kidneys. Not only did Sambong reduce the size of
    the crystals, but it also inhibited its aggregation. This means that aside from
    being used as kidney stone treatment, one of the other Sambong benefits is the
    prevention of stone formation.\r\n\r\nSambong helps in treating high blood pressure\r\nWhen
    the extract of Sambong is injected, blood vessels become \u201Cloosened\u201D
    or they expand. This significantly helps in relieving hypertension. Do not inject
    Sambong into your bloodstream. Always consult your doctor.  \r\n\r\nSambong promotes
    diuresis\r\nDiuresis means increased urination; this happens when our kidneys
    filter large volumes of fluid. While it sounds bothersome, diuresis helps in
    the removal of toxins. \r\n\r\nSambong reduces edema\r\nEdema, or commonly called
    \u201Cmanas,\u201D happens when our tissues or cavities retain fluids, resulting
    in swelling. The frequent urination caused by Sambong helps to release those
    extra fluids, thus relieving the edema. \r\n\r\nSambong brings down fever\r\nAnother
    one of the unique Sambong is its ability to address high fever. Because Sambong
    has menthol, it helps cool down your body temperature.\r\n\r\nSambong aids in
    treating cough and cold\r\nThis unique medicinal plant has expectorant properties,
    one of the prized Sambong benefits. This means that it can help remove unwanted
    phlegm that accumulates in our respiratory tracts.\r\n\r\nSambong has antimicrobial
    properties that help in a lot of diseases. Perhaps one of the best Sambong benefits
    is its ability to destroy bacteria and other microbes. Coupled with its anti-inflammatory
    chemicals, Sambong can be used to help in the treatment of diarrhea and stomach-ache;
    skin problems, like worms and boils; sore throat; and rheumatism.\r\n\r\nHow
    does it work?\r\nSambong benefits are numerous and far-reaching, from relieving
    fevers to alleviating high blood pressure and preventing kidney stones. Its effectivity
    as a medicinal plant has been well-accepted, but its success is more anecdotal
    than based on science and studies. \r\n\r\nPrecautions & Warnings\r\nWhat should
    I know before using Sambong?\r\nAlthough there are a lot of Sambong benefits,
    there should still be considerations.  \r\n\r\nWhile uncommon, Sambong may cause
    allergic reactions, especially in people allergic to ragweed plants and other
    plants related to it. No trials have been conducted to study its safety and effectiveness
    when used by pregnant women or breastfeeding mothers.\r\n\r\nSince it is a diuretic
    agent, you may suffer dehydration if you do not carefully replace your fluids.\r\n\r\nHow
    safe is Sambong?\r\nOne of the best things about Sambong is that it is generally
    safe to use. The DOH\u2019s Philippine Institute of Traditional and Alternative
    Health Care even promotes the tablet form of powdered Sambong leaves.\r\n\r\nSpecial
    precautions & warnings\r\nThere is not enough data to prove that it is safe for
    pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, so it is best to avoid it if you are
    with child. Also, be very careful if you are allergic to ragweed plants and their
    relatives. Always consult your physician before taking Sambong \u2013 in tea
    or tablet form \u2013 if you have existing kidney conditions.\r\n\r\nSide Effects
    & Interactions\r\nWhat kind of side effects may I have from Sambong?\r\nFortunately,
    Sambong has no known side effects. But Sambong has been known to cause allergic
    reaction, particularly for those with sensitivity to ragweed plants and the like.\r\n\r\nOther
    possible side effects are skin irritation and itching.\r\n\r\nWhat interactions
    may I have with Sambong?\r\nSambong also has no drug or food interactions. Still,
    it is best to talk to your physician if you are under a certain diet. The same
    thing should be done if you are taking other medications.\r\n\r\nDosage\r\nWhat
    is the usual dose for Sambong?\r\nSambong benefits can be harnessed in various
    ways. A gentle reminder: the dosages and applications listed below are meant
    to help and should not be prioritized over a physician\u2019s advice."
